# Market Replication Logic

Expansion decisions were not opportunistic.

Markets were evaluated using structured scoring criteria.

## Market Qualification Inputs

- Demographic density
- Competitive landscape
- Labor availability
- Regulatory friction
- Capital deployment threshold
- Projected margin profile

## Expansion Trigger Logic

Markets were approved when:

- Operational readiness score exceeded predefined benchmark.

## Strategic Insight

Replication discipline reduces expansion volatility.

Scalable growth is engineered through structured qualification, not enthusiasm.
