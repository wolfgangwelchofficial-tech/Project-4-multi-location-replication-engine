# Role Clarity & Authority Architecture

Operational variance is rarely caused by incompetence.

It is caused by unclear authority.

As expansion accelerated, decision ambiguity created drift across markets:

- Revenue categorization inconsistencies
- Labor scheduling autonomy misalignment
- Vendor contract fragmentation
- Compliance documentation ownership gaps

Role clarity was formalized to eliminate diffusion of responsibility.

## Decision Rights Architecture

Authority was explicitly structured across four tiers:

Tier 1 — Location GM  
Tier 2 — Regional Operations  
Tier 3 — Corporate Functional Leadership  
Tier 4 — Executive Oversight  

Each critical function was mapped to defined authority boundaries.

## Functional Authority Matrix

| Function                     | GM | Regional Ops | Corporate | Executive |
|------------------------------|----|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Revenue Reporting Logic      | R  | C           | A         | -         |
| Labor Model Design           | R  | A           | C         | -         |
| Vendor Contract Approval     | C  | R           | A         | -         |
| KPI Definition Changes       | -  | C           | R         | A         |
| Compliance Certification     | R  | C           | A         | -         |
| Expansion Approval           | -  | C           | C         | A         |

R = Responsible  
A = Accountable  
C = Consulted

## Authority Boundaries

Defined boundaries included:

- GMs could adjust schedules within tolerance bands, but not redefine labor model assumptions.
- Regional Ops could recommend vendor changes, but corporate approved contract execution.
- KPI definitions were centralized to preserve enterprise comparability.
- Expansion authorization required executive-level accountability.

Autonomy was preserved within guardrails.

Outside guardrails, authority centralized.

## Escalation Protocol

If decision conflict occurred:

Step 1: Regional review within 48 hours.  
Step 2: Corporate mediation if unresolved.  
Step 3: Executive arbitration for systemic impact decisions.

Escalation timelines were enforced to prevent decision latency.

## Accountability Linkage

Role clarity was tied to performance outcomes.

Examples:

- GM compensation aligned to labor band compliance.
- Regional leadership evaluated on margin variance compression.
- Corporate oversight measured by audit completion and forecast accuracy.

Authority without accountability was not permitted.

## Friction Case — Authority Reassignment

In early rollout:

Two high-performing GMs resisted centralized labor model adjustments.

Argument:
"Local knowledge outperforms corporate model."

Resolution:
Labor variance modeling demonstrated long-term drift risk.

Authority reaffirmed.
Compensation tied to compliance.

Outcome:
Margin volatility reduced without revenue loss.

## Strategic Outcome

Role clarity reduced:

- Decision ambiguity
- Escalation delays
- KPI reinterpretation
- Vendor fragmentation

Authority architecture ensured scalability did not dilute accountability.

As markets expanded, responsibility became sharper — not diffused.
