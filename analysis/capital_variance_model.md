# Capital Variance Exposure Model

Variance across markets compounds capital inefficiency.

Before standardization:

Average margin volatility: ±6%  
Average labor volatility: ±8%  

Across 8 markets, this equated to:

~$1.2M annualized forecast instability.

After replication engine enforcement:

Margin volatility reduced to ±2%  
Labor volatility reduced to ±3%

Enterprise forecast stability improved by ~68%.

## Strategic Implication

Predictable margin variance enables:

- Accurate capital allocation
- Confident expansion pacing
- Liquidity buffer optimization
