# Institutional Bandwidth Constraint Model

Expansion speed is limited not by opportunity — but by replication capacity.

Each new market consumed:

- Executive review bandwidth
- Compliance oversight hours
- KPI monitoring capacity
- Vendor contract negotiation time

Replication capacity was modeled as:

Maximum concurrent new markets supported without degradation of oversight quality.

When active expansion exceeded this limit:

- Escalation response time increased
- KPI review cadence slipped
- Margin drift widened

Policy:
Expansion approvals were throttled based on institutional bandwidth — not just capital availability.

## Modeled Capacity Threshold

Maximum concurrent new market launches supported without degradation:

3 markets per 120-day window.

When attempted 4th concurrent launch:

- Escalation review time increased by 22%.
- KPI review cadence slipped by one reporting cycle.
- Margin deviation widened by 1.8%.

Policy formalized:
Expansion throttled at 3 concurrent launches.
