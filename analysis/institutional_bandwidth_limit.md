# Institutional Bandwidth Constraint Model

Expansion speed is limited not by opportunity — but by replication capacity.

Each new market consumed:

- Executive review bandwidth
- Compliance oversight hours
- KPI monitoring capacity
- Vendor contract negotiation time

Replication capacity was modeled as:

Maximum concurrent new markets supported without degradation of oversight quality.

When active expansion exceeded this limit:

- Escalation response time increased
- KPI review cadence slipped
- Margin drift widened

Policy:
Expansion approvals were throttled based on institutional bandwidth — not just capital availability.
