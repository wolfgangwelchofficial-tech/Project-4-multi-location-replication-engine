# Decision Log Snapshot — Replication Engine

Standardization introduced structured decision tracking to prevent drift.

Below is a snapshot of actual governance-level decisions during rollout.

---

## Decision 001 — KPI Definition Override

Issue:
Two high-performing markets calculated gross margin differently.

Risk:
Enterprise comparability compromised.

Decision:
Override local calculation methodology and enforce centralized margin logic.

Impact:
Short-term margin compression in one market (-2.3%)  
Long-term comparability achieved.

## Decision 004 — Labor Band Adjustment

Issue:
Seasonal volatility caused repeated yellow-band triggers in coastal markets.

Decision:
Introduce seasonal tolerance adjustment band (+2% winter, -1% summer).

Impact:
False-positive escalations reduced by 40%.

---

## Decision 007 — Market Disqualification

Issue:
High-demand market scored 3.48 (threshold 3.5).

Pressure:
Local leadership advocated override.

Decision:
Disqualify under policy.

Result:
Six months later, comparable competitor exited market due to labor instability.

## Structural Outcome

The replication engine functioned not as documentation — but as institutional memory.

## Decision Pattern Analysis

Across 12 logged governance decisions:

- 5 involved KPI definition overrides.
- 3 involved labor band recalibration.
- 2 involved vendor contract consolidation.
- 2 involved market disqualification.

Most volatility originated from:
1. Labor modeling inconsistency.
2. Margin definition drift.

This informed Version 2.0 dashboard redesign.
