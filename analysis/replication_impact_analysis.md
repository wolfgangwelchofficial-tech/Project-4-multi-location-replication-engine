## Baseline Condition (Pre-Standardization)

Across 8 operating markets:

| Metric                    | Lowest Market | Highest Market | Variance Spread |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Gross Margin              | 58%          | 70%            | 12%            |
| Labor % of Revenue        | 26%          | 38%            | 12%            |
| Revenue per FTE           | $9,200       | $14,100       | 53% delta      |

Performance volatility was driven primarily by:
- Inconsistent labor modeling.
- Localized vendor pricing variance.
- Non-uniform KPI definitions.
