# Replication Engine Impact Analysis

## Baseline Condition (Pre-Standardization)

Across 8 operating markets:

| Metric                    | Lowest Market | Highest Market | Variance Spread |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Gross Margin              | 58%          | 70%            | 12%            |
| Labor % of Revenue        | 26%          | 38%            | 12%            |
| Revenue per FTE           | $9,200       | $14,100       | 53% delta      |

Performance volatility was driven primarily by:
- Inconsistent labor modeling.
- Localized vendor pricing variance.
- Non-uniform KPI definitions.

## Post-Implementation (6-Month Window)

| Metric                    | Lowest Market | Highest Market | Variance Spread |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Gross Margin              | 63%          | 67%            | 4%             |
| Labor % of Revenue        | 27%          | 30%            | 3%             |
| Revenue per FTE           | $11,800      | $12,900       | 9% delta       |

Variance compression was driven by:

1. Enforced labor scheduling models.
2. Standardized vendor contract renegotiation.
3. Removal of inconsistent revenue categorization.

## Enterprise Effect

Reduced variance improved:

- Forecast reliability.
- Capital planning accuracy.
- Expansion confidence.
- Liquidity modeling precision.

---

## Measurement Methodology

Variance was calculated using rolling 90-day performance windows across active markets.

Outliers were defined as deviations exceeding one standard deviation from portfolio mean.

Data sources:
- Standardized POS revenue export
- Payroll labor allocation reports
- Vendor invoice reconciliation
- Centralized KPI dashboard

Pre-implementation period: 6 months  
Post-implementation evaluation window: 6 months  

This ensured that improvements were structural — not seasonal artifacts.
