# Iteration & Versioning

Version 1.0 of the replication engine revealed gaps:

- KPI dashboards overloaded with non-essential metrics.
- Labor tolerance bands too tight for seasonal markets.
- Compliance checklist duplicated across tools.

Adjustments:

Version 1.1:
- Reduced KPI dashboard from 22 metrics to 9 executive indicators.
- Adjusted tolerance bands seasonally.
- Centralized compliance tracking into one repository.

Version 2.0:
- Automated variance alerts.
- Integrated vendor performance scoring.
- Added market qualification scoring gate.

Strategic Insight:
Standardization is not static.
It evolves under pressure.
