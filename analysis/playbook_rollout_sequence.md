# Replication Engine Implementation Sequence

The replication engine was not implemented universally at once.

It was rolled out in phased waves.

---

## Phase 1 — Diagnostic (Weeks 1–3)

Objective: Identify operational variance.

Actions:
- Collected KPI definitions from each region.
- Compared labor % variance across markets.
- Mapped tool stack fragmentation.
- Identified inconsistent vendor contract terms.

Finding:
No two markets defined revenue or margin identically.

---

## Phase 2 — Standardization Design (Weeks 4–8)

Objective: Create unified operating architecture.

Actions:
- Rewrote KPI definitions at corporate level.
- Established margin calculation uniformity.
- Defined labor target bands.
- Centralized vendor contract structure.

Resistance:
Regional leaders resisted removal of local reporting autonomy.

Resolution:
Introduced dual reporting period (legacy + standardized) for 30 days to ease transition.

---

## Phase 3 — Enforcement & Calibration (Weeks 9–16)

Objective: Reduce variance within tolerance bands.

Actions:
- Weekly red-band review calls.
- Mandatory GM KPI intervention plans.
- Regional scorecards published publicly across markets.

Result:
Margin variance narrowed from double-digit swings to mid-single digits.

---

## Inflection Point

During Phase 2, two markets delayed KPI adoption citing reporting fatigue.

Risk:
Dual-reporting period extended beyond 30 days would compromise standardization.

Resolution:
Executive mandate issued.
Legacy reporting sunset date enforced.
Adoption compliance tied to leadership evaluation.

Lesson:
Standardization requires authority, not consensus.
