# Variance Intervention Case — Labor Drift Correction

## Scenario

Location: Reno Market  
Issue: Labor % of revenue at 36% (target 28%)  
Deviation: +8% over tolerance band  

## Root Cause Analysis

- Overstaffed weekend shifts.
- Inefficient scheduling model.
- Incentive misalignment at GM level.

## Weekly Intervention Cadence

Week 1:
- Identified overstaffed peak windows via hourly revenue mapping.
- Modeled optimal labor band per hour.

Week 2:
- Reduced weekend shift overlap by 14%.
- Introduced minimum revenue threshold per scheduled hour.

Week 3–4:
- GM compensation aligned to labor band compliance.
- Weekly red-band review introduced.

Week 6:
- Labor % reduced from 36% → 30%.
- Revenue held within ±2% baseline.

Key Mechanism:
Not cost cutting — labor alignment to revenue density.

## Outcome

Within 6 weeks:

- Labor % reduced to 30%.
- Revenue held stable.
- Margin improvement of 4.5%.

## Strategic Insight

Standardization without enforcement does not reduce variance.

Institutional discipline requires intervention modeling.
