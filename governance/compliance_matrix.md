# Governance & Compliance Layer

Multi-state expansion increases regulatory complexity.

To prevent licensing drift and compliance variance, a centralized governance structure was implemented.

## Governance Controls

- State-by-state licensing matrix.
- Permit renewal tracking system.
- Audit cadence calendar.
- Compliance documentation repository.

## Risk Mitigation

Compliance was treated as a parallel workstream — not a post-launch function.

This prevented last-minute launch instability and capital timing risk.
