# Market Replication Logic

Expansion decisions were not opportunistic.

Markets were evaluated using structured scoring criteria.

## Weighted Market Scoring Model

Each market was evaluated using a weighted scoring framework.

| Factor                    | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Demographic Density       | 20%    | 4           | 0.8            |
| Competitive Landscape     | 15%    | 3           | 0.45           |
| Labor Availability        | 20%    | 5           | 1.0            |
| Regulatory Friction       | 15%    | 2           | 0.30           |
| Margin Projection         | 20%    | 4           | 0.8            |
| Capital Deployment Risk   | 10%    | 3           | 0.30           |

Total Score: 3.65 / 5

Minimum Expansion Threshold: 3.5

## Sensitivity Scenario

If margin projection decreases by 5% due to competitive saturation:

Original Weighted Score: 3.65  
Adjusted Score: 3.32  

Threshold: 3.5  

Outcome:
Market disqualified under downside stress scenario.

This prevented optimistic modeling from driving premature capital deployment.

## Expansion Trigger Logic

Markets were approved when:

- Projected margin met minimum threshold.
- Capital payback fell within modeled tolerance.
- Operational readiness score exceeded predefined benchmark.

---

## Strategic Insight

Replication discipline reduces expansion volatility.

Scalable growth is engineered through structured qualification, not enthusiasm.
