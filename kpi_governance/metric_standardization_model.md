# KPI Harmonization Framework

Expansion creates metric drift.

To enable regional comparability, KPIs were standardized across markets.

## Harmonization Controls

- Unified revenue categorization.

## Regional Comparability Model

Each location reported against identical KPI definitions.

Variance was measured against standardized performance bands:

Green: Within 5% tolerance  
Yellow: 5–10% deviation  
Red: >10% deviation  

This allowed leadership to isolate execution gaps versus market-specific factors.
