# Regional Comparability Framework

Standardized KPIs enable measurement.

Regional comparability enables decision authority.

Without normalization, leadership cannot distinguish:

- Market-driven variance
- Execution-driven variance
- Structural pricing differences
- Labor environment distortion

Comparability was engineered to isolate execution performance from market conditions.

## Normalization Controls

To ensure apples-to-apples comparison, metrics were normalized across markets for:

1. Revenue Categorization
   - Unified classification of service revenue, ancillary revenue, and discounts.

2. Margin Calculation
   - Standardized cost allocation model (COGS uniformity).

3. Labor Allocation
   - Consistent payroll segmentation (front-of-house vs operational overhead).

4. Inventory Accounting
   - Centralized cost recognition timing.

This eliminated accounting-induced performance distortion.

## Market Adjustment Layer

Certain variables required contextual normalization:

- Seasonal labor volatility
- Local wage differentials
- Regulatory tax variance
- Vendor cost fluctuation

Adjusted reporting included:

- Raw performance
- Adjusted enterprise-normalized performance

Leadership reviewed both.

This prevented over-correction in structurally advantaged or disadvantaged markets.

## Variance Mapping Model

Markets were evaluated across two axes:

X-Axis: Execution Discipline  
Y-Axis: Market Structural Advantage  

This created four quadrants:

1. Strong Market / Strong Execution
2. Strong Market / Weak Execution
3. Weak Market / Strong Execution
4. Weak Market / Weak Execution

Intervention priority targeted:

Weak Execution markets regardless of structural conditions.

This prevented structural excuses from masking operational drift.
